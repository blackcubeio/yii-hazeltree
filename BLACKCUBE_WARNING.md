# ⚠️ Blackcube Warning

> **Yes, it exists. So what? We do it differently.**

**Heads up: it looks like what you know. It's not what you think.**

Looks like flexible storage? Yet it's queryable like a good old relational database.  
Handles trees (menus, categories)? Yet it stays fast even when things move around.  
Tastes like a familiar solution? That's when you should start asking questions. Blackcube likes the road less traveled.

## The options

**Acceptable:**
- Use it — the API is often simple, the tech stays under the hood
- Walk away — other solutions exist

**Unacceptable:**
- Claiming "it's useless" without understanding it

---

It's unsettling. That's normal — few have tried to solve the problem in a generic way (Blackcube hates throwaway code).  
And yet it works.

Leave your assumptions at the door if you want to dive in and enjoy the ride.

## The Blackcube philosophy

Code is an MMA cage. All strikes allowed as long as you get the result.

- Blackcube innovates — take existing bricks, assemble them differently, solve a real problem
- Code built to last — we aim for years, not months
- More industrialization = less code = fewer bugs
- Technical archaeology — smarter people have worked on this before, might as well use their contributions

Waiting for things to happen on their own? That's not Blackcube's style. When you chase perfection and aim for excellence to get anywhere close, you roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.
